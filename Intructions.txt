Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up and Run the Application

1. **Install Dependencies for Client and Server**

   a. Open your terminal/command prompt.
   
   b. Navigate to the `client` directory:
      ```
      cd client
      ```
   
   c. Run the following command to install the required packages for the client:
      ```
      npm install
      ```

   d. Next, navigate to the `server` directory:
      ```
      cd server
      ```

   e. Install the required packages for the server:
      ```
      npm install
      ```

2. **Explanation: Why This Is Necessary**
   - `npm install` installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` files inside both the `client` and `server` directories.
   - Each directory (client and server) has its own `package.json` because they likely have different dependencies specific to either the client-side (e.g., React, Vite) or server-side (e.g., Express, Mongoose).

3. **.gitignore: Ignore Unnecessary Files**
   
   a. **Why Use .gitignore?**
      - `.gitignore` tells Git which files or directories to ignore when you push to the repository. This prevents unnecessary or large files from being uploaded, which could slow down the repository or expose sensitive information.
   
   b. **Create .gitignore File (If It Doesn’t Exist)**
      - If your project doesn’t have a `.gitignore` file yet, create one in the root directory of your project.
      - Add the following lines to the `.gitignore` file to ignore node_modules and environment files:
        ```
        node_modules/
        .env
        .env.local
        .env.development
        .env.production
        ```

   c. **Why Ignore node_modules?**
      - `node_modules/` is the folder where all the project dependencies are stored. It can be very large and does not need to be included in your Git repository since it can be recreated by running `npm install` on another machine.

4. **Running the Application**

   a. **Start the Client-Side Application:**
   
      - In the terminal, navigate to the `client` directory:
        ```
        cd client
        ```
   
      - Run the client application using Vite (or other relevant commands based on your setup):
        ```
        npm run dev
        ```
   
      - This will start the client-side application and typically open a browser window with the app running on a local server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or another port).

   b. **Start the Server-Side Application:**

      - In the terminal, navigate to the `server` directory:
        ```
        cd ../server
        ```
   
      - Run the server application using Node.js:
        ```
        node index.js
        ```
      - This will start the server-side application (or the main JS file) and establish the backend of the application.

5. **Why Do Both Applications Need to Run?**
   - The client-side and server-side need to run together because the client (front-end) communicates with the server (back-end) to retrieve data or handle user requests. If either side isn't running, the application won't work properly.
   
   - The client sends requests (like API calls) to the server. If the server isn't running, the client won’t be able to interact with the back-end, and the app will fail to work as expected.

6. **Final Notes**
   - After setting up, if you make changes to the code and are ready to push your updates to the repository, make sure the `.gitignore` is properly set up and that `node_modules/` and `.env` files are ignored. This will keep your Git repository clean and free of unnecessary files.
